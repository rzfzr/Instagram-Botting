# Instagram-Botting

Badly written and performant but definitely not being recognized as a bot any time soon. Basically a keyboard macro using AHK and Containers inside Firefox.

AHK: https://autohotkey.com  
Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/  
Containers: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/  
Image blocker (recommended): https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easy-image-blocker/?src=api  

1. Install everything
2. Populate both CSV
3. Run .ahk
4. Press esc to stop/reload/bring up menu
5. Go do something else

Works best with 15+ accounts as the desktop version of instagram has a limit of followers per 5 minutes.
